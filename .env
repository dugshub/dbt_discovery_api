We need to update the 3 new methods in the models api. We're currently getting all models, but just their name. Then looping through for their average runtime. Instead, we should be using the get models service to pull all models at once with their most recent run information. We can ignore average for now, as we'll need to compute that differently.                                            │
│  We should access it through: query.environment.applied.models.edges.node.executionInfo() (node would be ModelNode i think, so we can  │
│   specify alias and other metadata at that level before pulling execution info). Please review and         │
│   propose a high level implementation plan before proceeding.
