> create the Job endpoint in the serivce layer mirroring the implementation of  Base and Environment endpoints

## High-Level Objective

- Create the Job endpoint in the service layer
- Identify the neceissary user API endpoints bawed on what we have for Model and Project, use this to ensure the base queries are correct       

## Mid-Level Objective

- Create the appropriate types based on the graphQL Schema
- Create the appropriate base queries based on the graphQL Schema mirroring the implementation from Base and EnvironemtQuery
